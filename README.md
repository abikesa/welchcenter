Good morning, 

I'm Katie â€“ the Welch Center's communications specialist. I'm in charge of coordinating our Grand Rounds sessions each week.

Our pearl coordinator, Henry Zhao, said you will virtually present a brief research pearl next week on "GitHub and Stata." Is all of that correct? If so, thanks so much for your willingness to present to our group! ðŸ™‚

I did want to note a few things ahead of next week:
Zoom information
Meeting ID: 928 4815 4051
Passcode: 092395
Link: https://jhjhm.zoom.us/j/92848154051?pwd=dWdwTDJjMHM4V3BPSjA5L2I2dXJqZz09
Please join the meeting around 11:45 a.m. to run through audio/video setup.
Research pearl presentations are 5 minutes long.
I will be out of the office next week.
Patricia "Pat" Bayton (CC'd) is coordinating Grand Rounds for me in my absence. I'm available to answer any questions this week. After that, Pat will be your point of contact. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out; I'm here to help however I can. Thanks!

Hi Abimereki â€“
In Katieâ€™s absence, I am setting up Welch Center Grand Rounds.
Will your presentation be virtual or in-person?
 
Just a reminder that your presentation will start at 12:10 and be no more than 5 minutes.
If virtual, I will log in around 11:45 for a zoom check.
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
Best regards,
Pat
