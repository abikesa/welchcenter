For your presentation at the Welch Center, focusing on "GitHub and Stata" for an audience primarily composed of clinicians, PhDs, and public health students, you'll want to keep things simple, engaging, and directly relevant to their day-to-day work. Here's a strategic approach to structure your 5-minute presentation effectively:

### 1. **Introduction to the Problem (1 minute)**
Start by addressing a common frustration: the myriad of document versions like "manuscript_jan16.docx, manuscript_final.docx, manuscript_final_v2.docx," which everyone can relate to. This not only sets the stage but also hooks your audience by highlighting a familiar challenge.

### 2. **Introducing GitHub as a Solution (1 minute)**
Transition into introducing GitHub, but frame it not as a complex tech tool but as a simple solution for version control. You might say, "Imagine a world where you only have one document, and you can see every change made to it, who made it, and revert back to any version instantly. That’s what GitHub offers."

### 3. **Basic Concepts and Terminology (1 minute)**
Briefly introduce the basic concepts they need to understand:
- **Repository**: Like a project folder for all your documents and code.
- **Commit**: Saving a version of your documents with a note on what was changed.
- **Branch**: A copy of your project where you can try things out without affecting the main project.

### 4. **Integration with Stata (1 minute)**
Explain how GitHub can work with Stata by using simple scripts or data files. Highlight the benefits:
- Track changes in Stata code or data files over time.
- Collaborate easily with others, seeing who changed what and when.
- Maintain a clean audit trail for reproducible research.

### 5. **Call to Action and Resources (1 minute)**
Encourage them to try GitHub for one of their smaller, less critical projects to see the benefits firsthand. Provide a link or a QR code to a simple tutorial or a first-step guide tailored for researchers (you could create or find a basic one online). Mention that this small investment in learning a new tool can significantly streamline their work and reduce future headaches.

### Key Tips for Delivery:
- **Use Analogies**: Relate GitHub to something familiar—like tracking changes in a Word document but on a much larger and more controlled scale.
- **Keep It Visual**: Use simple diagrams or screenshots to illustrate how GitHub looks and works. Visual aids will be crucial to help demystify the platform.
- **Avoid Jargon**: Stick to simple language and avoid technical terms that aren't widely understood outside IT.

This approach should help make your brief presentation accessible and appealing, possibly sparking interest in adopting new tools for better data and research management.
