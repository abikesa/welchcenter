Absolutely, a brief but impactful "aperitivo" approach sounds perfect for your audience. Your goal is to whet their appetite for Open Science and tools like GitHub, not to overwhelm them with detail. Here’s a streamlined plan that introduces the concept effectively within your tight timeframe:

### 1. **Engaging Introduction (30 seconds)**
Begin with a relatable scenario highlighting the pain of disorganized project management—like the confusion caused by too many versions of the same document. Pose a question like, "Ever wondered if there’s a better way to manage our research projects, so we never lose track of the latest updates?"

### 2. **Introduce GitHub as a Tool for Open Science (1 minute)**
Briefly explain what GitHub is—an online platform that helps you manage projects and collaborate with others anywhere in the world. Use simple language to explain version control as a way to track every change in your documents or data, akin to an incredibly detailed history or audit trail.

### 3. **Highlight the Benefits (1 minute)**
Focus on the key advantages:
- **Transparency**: Every change is visible and attributed, making it easier to track progress and contributions.
- **Collaboration**: Share your work with colleagues across the globe, allowing for real-time contributions and reviews.
- **Preservation**: Every version of every file is saved, so you can always go back to previous versions.

### 4. **Real-World Application (1 minute)**
Mention a high-level example from the tech industry, like Facebook’s Llama-3, to illustrate how these practices are being implemented in other fields to great effect. Highlight how this approach can lead to faster advancements and increased trust in findings.

### 5. **Call to Action (30 seconds)**
Encourage them to explore more about Open Science and GitHub. Suggest starting with something small, like a personal project or upcoming research, to see the benefits firsthand. Provide them with a resource link or a handout with more detailed information and tutorials tailored for beginners.

### Tips for Delivery
- **Use Visuals**: A simple slide showing a GitHub repository's version history can visually explain the concept of version control.
- **Keep it Relevant**: Use analogies and examples that resonate with their daily experiences.
- **Encourage Curiosity**: Position your talk as an invitation to explore new tools that could make their research more efficient and reproducible.

This approach should intrigue your audience and spark interest in exploring new tools without delving too deeply into technical details, perfect for a brief introduction in a professional setting.
