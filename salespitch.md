The fact that major companies like Apple and Facebook, which traditionally compete with Microsoft, still use GitHub for hosting their public repositories is a strong testament to GitHub's effectiveness and the universality of Open Science principles. This aspect can serve as a compelling point in your presentation, emphasizing the widespread adoption and `cross-industry standardization` that GitHub represents, despite competitive business landscapes.

### How to Incorporate This into Your Aperitivo

**1. Highlight Industry Collaboration Over Competition (1 minute):**
- **Universal Tool**: Explain that GitHub is such a robust and universally applicable tool that even competitors in the tech industry set aside their rivalries to use it. This showcases its reliability and effectiveness.
- **Open Science**: Emphasize that GitHub embodies Open Science by making it easier for anyone, regardless of institutional affiliation, to share work and collaborate on projects. The use by Apple and Facebook illustrates that the platform's benefits are so significant that they outweigh competitive concerns.

**2. Make It Relatable (30 seconds):**
- **Analogy**: Use an analogy that resonates with the medical and public health field. For instance, just as different health institutions might use the same type of medical equipment or database systems despite being competitors, they do so because the benefits for patient care and research quality are undeniable. Similarly, GitHub is used across industries for its superior project management and collaborative features.

**3. Discuss Benefits in a Broader Context (1 minute):**
- **Standardization and Best Practices**: Point out that using such a platform promotes standardization of practices and adherence to the highest standards of data management and collaboration, which are critical in fields governed by stringent data integrity and reproducibility requirements like public health and clinical research.
- **Innovation and Speed**: Mention how these practices not only lead to better transparency and collaboration but also significantly speed up innovation, as seen in tech companies who are often the first to adopt cutting-edge tools to maintain competitive edges.

**4. Encourage Open-Mindedness (30 seconds):**
- **Invitation to Innovate**: Conclude by encouraging the audience to be open to integrating technologies from outside their usual toolset. Stress that embracing tools like GitHub could lead to significant advancements in how research is conducted and shared in their fields.

### Conclusion
Incorporating the fact that even direct competitors in the tech industry utilize GitHub can powerfully illustrate the tool's value and the concept of Open Science. It provides a clear example of how embracing universally beneficial tools can transcend individual corporate interests and foster greater innovation and collaboration, which are crucial in any field, especially one as impactful as public health and medicine. This part of your talk could inspire your audience to consider how adopting such tools might enhance their own work and the broader field.
